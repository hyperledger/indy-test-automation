# Chaos Engineering
Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in
order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent
conditions in production. -- principlesofchaos.org

## Chaostoolkit
“The Chaos Toolkit aims to be the simplest and easiest way to explore building
your own Chaos Engineering Experiments. It also aims to define a vendor and
technology independent way of specifying Chaos Engineering experiments by
providing an Open API.” (https://docs.chaostoolkit.org/)

## chaosindy
A number of actions and probes have been developed to facilitate composing
experiments for Hyperledger Indy. They are currently being maintained here in
the “chaosindy” python module.

When existing “chaosindy” actions and probes need to execute remotely, python
Fabric (built on top of paramiko - not to be confused with Hyperledger Fabric)
is used, which is “designed to execute shell commands remotely over SSH,
yielding useful Python objects in return”.

# Creating Experiments
“An Experiment declares a steady state hypothesis, alongside probes to validate
this steady state is met, and a method as a sequence [of] actions and probes,
to interact and query the system respectively.”
(https://docs.chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/)

Experiments are declared in JSON files and are composed of the following
elements. Ellipses (...) added for brevity:

* Version
* Title
* Description
* Tags
* Secrets
* Configuration
* Steady State Hypothesis
* Method
* Rollbacks

```
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "title": "Force View Change",
    "description": “...”,
    "tags": [...],
    "secrets": {...},
    "configuration": {...},
    "steady-state-hypothesis": {...},
    "method": [...],
    "rollbacks": [...]
}
```
## Version

The version property MUST be "0.1.0". The docs are not clear what the version
number is used for, but we suspect that the ‘chaos’ executable will eventually
need to know the version of API to use to parse/interpret and execute the
experiment.

The current specification has not reached its 1.0.0 stable version yet. Make
sure to join the discussion to provide any feedback you might have.

```
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    ...
}
```

## Title and Description

The experiment’s title and description are meant for humans and therefore
should be as descriptive as possible to clarify the experiment’s rationale.

```
{
    ...
    "title": "Force View Change",
    "description": “Reach steady state (can write a nym), discover which node is the master, stop the master (stop indy-node service) on that node to force a view change, wait a reasonable amount of time for the view change to complete, verify another node has been selected as the new master, bring up the old master, and then ensure the cluster is still in consensus (can write a nym). This experiment can be repeated to 'chase the master'.
”,
    ...
}
```

## Tags

Tags provide a way of categorizing experiments. It is a sequence of JSON
strings.

```
{
    ...
    "tags": [
        "service",
        "indy-node",
        "consensus"
    ],
    ...
}
```

## Secrets
Secrets declare values that need to be passed on to Actions or Probes in a
secure manner.

Secrets may be inlined, passed via the environment, or retrieved from a
HashiCorp vault instance.

```
{
    ...
    "secrets": {
        "sovrin": {
            "seed": “0000000000000000000000000Trustee1”,
            "env-seed": {
                “type”: “env”,
                “key”: “CHAOS_SEED”
            },
            "vault-seed": {
                “type”: “vault”,
                “key”: “chaos/seed”
            }
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

## Configuration
Configuration is meant to provide runtime values to actions and probes.

```
{
    ...
    "configuration": {
        "genesis_file": {
            "type": "env",
            "key": "CHAOS_GENESIS_FILE"
        },
        "write_nym_timeout": {
            "type": "env",
            "key": "CHAOS_WRITE_NYM_TIMEOUT"
        },
       "cleanup": {
            "type": "env",
            "key": "CHAOS_CLEANUP"
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

## Steady State Hypothesis
The Steady State Hypothesis element describes what normal looks like in your
system before the Method element is applied. If the steady state is not met, the
Method element is not applied and the experiment MUST bail out.

The Steady State Hypothesis is checked before and after the Method element is
applied, is entirely composed of one or more probes with a “tolerance” element
(predicate) acting as a gate mechanism.

```
{
    ...
    "steady-state-hypothesis": {
        "title": "Can write nym",
        "probes": [
            {
                "type": "probe",
                "name": "can-write-nym",
                "tolerance": true,
                "provider": {
                    "type": "python",
                    "module": "chaosindy.probes.write_nym",
                    "func": "write_nym",
                    "arguments": {
                        "seed": "${seed}",
                        "genesis_file": "${genesis_file}",
                        "pool_name": "fvc_pool1",
                        "my_wallet_name": "fvc_my_wallet1",
                        "their_wallet_name": "fvc_their_wallet1",
                        "timeout": "${write_nym_timeout}"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    },

    ...
}
```

## Method
The Method describes the ordered sequence of Probe and Action elements to apply.

The “stop-primary” and “start-stopped-primary-after-view-change” actions could
be combined into a “force-view-change” action.

Composition can be done in the experiment or in the modules (probe, action
modules).

```
{
    ...
    "method": [{
        "type": "action",
        "name": "stop-primary",
        "provider": {
            "type": "python",
            "module": "chaosindy.actions.primary",
            "func": "stop_primary",
            "arguments": {
                "genesis_file": "${genesis_file}"
            }
        }
    },{
        "type": "action",
        "name": " start-stopped-primary-after-view-change",
        "provider": {
            "type": "python",
            "module": "chaosindy.actions.primary",
            "func": "start_stopped_primary_after_view_change",
            "arguments": {
                "genesis_file": "${genesis_file}"
            }
        }
    }],
    ...
}
```

## Rollbacks
Rollbacks declare the sequence of actions that attempt to put the system back to
its initial state.

Rollbacks are called regardless of what happens during Method execution. If all
probes/actions execute w/o problems, rollbacks are executed. If one or more
probes/actions stacktrace, rollbacks are executed.

Rollbacks are like the “finally” clause in a try...except...finally block.

```
{
    ...
    "rollbacks": [
        {
            "type": "action",
            "name": "start-stopped-primary",
            "provider": {
                "type": "python",
                "module": "chaosindy.actions.primary",
                "func": "start_stopped_primary",
                "arguments": {
                    "genesis_file": "${genesis_file}"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "action",
            "name": "cleanup-validator-info",
            "provider": {
                "type": "python",
                "module": "chaosindy.actions.validator_info",
                "func": "delete_validator_info",
                "arguments": {
                    "cleanup": "${cleanup}"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

# Probes and Actions
A Probe collects information from the system during the Steady State Hypothesis,
or Method phases of an experiment.

An Action collects information and/or performs an operation against the system
(i.e. stop-master, or start-stopped-master) during the Method and Rollback
phases of an experiment.

The Steady State Hypothesis phase is executed before and after the Method phase.
It is a sequence of Probes that declare an additional property named
“tolerance”. The tolerance is a condition/predicate that must be true for the
experiment to succeed/pass. If a Probe is used in the Method of an experiment,
the tolerance is checked/evaluated, but will NOT cause the experiment to fail.

The Method phase is a sequence of Probes and Actions.

The Rollback phase is a sequence of Actions.

## Probe
When declared fully, a Probe MUST declare:
* type property
* name property
* provider property

The type property MUST be the JSON string "probe".

The name property is a free-form JSON string that MAY be considered as an
identifier within the experiment.

It MAY also declare:
* secret property
* configuration property
* background property - MUST not block and the next Action or Probe should
  immediately be applied. Default: false

```
{
    "type": "probe",
    "name": "can-write-nym",
    "tolerance": true,
    "provider": {
        "type": "python",
        "module": "chaosindy.probes.write_nym",
        "func": "write_nym",
        "arguments": {
            "seed": "${seed}",
            "genesis_file": "${genesis_file}",
            "pool_name": "fvc_pool1",
            "my_wallet_name": "fvc_my_wallet1",
            "their_wallet_name": "fvc_their_wallet1",
            "timeout": "${write_nym_timeout}"
        }
    },
    “background”: false
}
```

## Action
When declared fully, a Action MUST declare:
* type property
* name property
* provider property
The type property MUST be the JSON string "action".
The name property is a free-form JSON string that MAY be considered as an
identifier within the experiment.
It MAY also declare:
* secret property
* configuration property
* background property
* pauses property - number indicating the number of seconds to wait before
  continuing

```
{
    "type": "action",
    "name": "stop-primary",
    "provider": {
	"type": "python",
	"module": "chaosindy.actions.primary",
	"func": "stop_primary",
	"arguments": {
	    "genesis_file": "${genesis_file}"
	}
    }
}
```

# Chaos Environment - Install and Config
## Installation
Setup and configure the chaosindy project on a client node.
### Clone chaosindy repo:
```
ubuntu@client1:~$ git clone https://github.com/evernym/chaosindy.git
ubuntu@client1:~$ cd chaosindy
```
### Install chaostoolkit inside a python virtual environment:
```ubuntu@client1:~$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv libffi-dev
ubuntu@client1:~$ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/chaostk
ubuntu@client1:~$ source  ~/.venvs/chaostk/bin/activate
(chaostk) ubuntu@client1:~$
```
### Install the chaosindy package in the python virtual environment:
```
(chaostk) ubuntu@client1:~$ python3 setup.py develop
```
Dependencies are being installed in a python virtualenv in your
~/.venvs directory. Nothing is installed in system-wide site-packages.
Therefore, do not run the above command with sudo.

## Configuration
### SSH
Python Fabric needs to know how to connect to each node without a password:
#### ~/.ssh/config
“Evernym-QA-New” in the IdentifyFile path below is a collection of PEM files
provided by the QA team used when setting up a test cluster.

Add an entry in ~/.ssh/config for every entry in a cluster’s
pool_trasactions_genesis file. The Host and Hostname are taken from
txnMetadata.txn.data.data.alias and txnMetadata.txn.data.data.node_ip
respectively.

TODO: Create a helper script to generate a ~/.ssh/config file from a
pool_transactions_genesis file.

Host Node1
    User ubuntu
    Hostname 1.2.3.4
    IdentityFile /home/ubuntu/pemfiles/node1.pem

"Node1" is used as the node's alias from the genesis transaction file
"ubuntu" is the login name to use when logging into Node1
"1.2.3.4" is the IP address to use when logging into Node1
"/home/ubuntu/pemfiles/node1.pem" is the pem file containing the private key to
use to login to Node1 as user ubuntu. The ubuntu user must have the public key
in it's /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

#### Test SSH connectivity
Test your SSH configuration for each client and validator node in your cluster/pool:
```
$ ssh Node1

Last login: Tue Jul 17 19:40:31 2018 from 5.6.7.8
ubuntu@node1:~$
```

You should be able to login as the designated user (user ‘ubuntu’ in this case)
to each node without a password.

### sudo
Some experiments may require probes and/or actions to run with sudo level
permissions. Test that the user configured in ~/.ssh/config for each host has
passwordless sudo rights.
```
ubuntu@kellysaopaulo1:~$ sudo su -
root@kellysaopaulo1:~#
```
The ‘ubuntu’ user in the above example either needs to be a member of the sudo
group or have a `ubuntu ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL` entry in /etc/sudoers
```
ubuntu@kellysaopaulo1:~$ groups
ubuntu adm dialout cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev netdev lxd
```
Note that the ubuntu user is a member of group *sudo*

### Recording
Indy Node’s recording feature provides a deterministic way of reproducing,
visually debugging, and fixing faults and failures. Add the following property
to /etc/indy/indy_config.py and restart the indy-node service.
```
STACK_COMPANION = 1
```

# Executing Experiments
Each chaosindy experiment has an associated “run” script (see scripts/run-*)
and the run.py script (work in progress) leverages these to allow a user to
create a suite/batch (one or more) of experiments to run.

Experiments can be executed from any host where the following is true:
- chaosindy is installed and configured (~/.ssh/config, etc…)
- All client and validator nodes are reachable.

run.py TODOs:
* Create a report from the journal.json output from each experiment and include
  the following for each experiment derived from each experiment's journal.json.
  Currently, each time run.py is invoked, a temporary directory is created and
  a "report" file is created/updated in that directory as experiments execute.
  The directory name/location is printed to stdout.
  * For each experiment:
    * Title: ['experiment']['title']
    * Description: ['experiment']['description]
    * Status: ['status']
    * Steady State status before method:
      ['steady_states']['before']['steady-state-met'] -> true or false
      If false, list failed probe name(s) and their and their output.
      Name: ['steady_states']['before']['steady-state-met']['probes'][0-N]['activity']['name']
      Output: ['steady_states']['before']['steady-state-met']['probes'][0-N]['output']
    * For each activity in the method:
      Name: ['run'][0-N]['activity']['name']
      Type: ['run'][0-N]['activity']['type'] -> action or probe
      Output: ['run'][0-N]['output'] -> Perhaps should always be true or false.
      Status: ['run'][0-N]['status'] -> "succeeded" or "failed"
    * Steady State status after method:
      ['steady_states']['after']['steady-state-met'] -> true or false
      If false, list failed probe name(s) and their and their output.
      Name: ['steady_states']['after']['steady-state-met']['probes'][0-N]['activity']['name']
      Output: ['steady_states']['after']['steady-state-met']['probes'][0-N]['output']
    * Rollback results
      Name: ['rollbacks'][0-N]['activity']['name']
      Output: ['rollbacks'][0-N]['activity']['output'] -> required all methods
      used to rollback changes to always return true or false?
      Status: ['rollbacks'][0-N]['activity']['status'] -> "succeeded" or
      "failed"?
    * (optional) Overall status. The default behavior of chaostoolkit is that
      experiments fail only if the steady state hypothesis is not met before and
      after the experiment's method is executed. An experiment's method is
      composed of one or more activities. If any/all of these activities
      encounter issues (raise exceptions, return false, etc.) the experiment
      ignores them and simply succeeds or fails based on the probes executed in
      the steady state hypothesis. Perhaps some logic needs to be added to
      report an overall status of 'fail'/'failed' if any of the activities in
      the experiment's method "fail"?
    * On failure (optionally - overall status failure), capture node state and
      include deposit location S3/filesystem in the report.
* Allow the user to specify an output directory. Currently, a temporary
  directory is generated each time run.py is invoked.
* Complete and test S3 integration
  * On individual experiment failure, capture node state and upload to S3
  * Upload generated report to S3
* Complete and test notification feature. Perhaps notification(s) should only be
  sent if at least one experiment "fails" (based on Experiment status OR Overall
  status)?
* Complete and test a node reset (delete domain and pool ledger) feature. Doing
  so will allow each experiment (running in a controlled environment) to start
  with a clean slate. Perhaps a user should be able to dictate which experiments
  get a clean slate before executing?

### Sample run.py execution
#### View help documentation
```
(chaostk) ubuntu@KellyStableClientVirgina:~/chaosindy$ ./run.py --help
```
#### Run force-view-change 1000 times and replica-selection once on pool1
```
(chaostk) ubuntu@KellyStableClientVirgina:~/chaosindy$ ./run.py pool1 --job-id "example-1" --experiments '{"force-view-change": {"execution-count": 1000}, "replica-selection": {}}' -l debug
```
#### Run all experiments using their defaults on pool2
```
(chaostk) ubuntu@KellyStableClientVirgina:~/chaosindy$ ./run.py pool2 --job-id "example-2"
```

Alternatively, each experiment has a “run” script in the ./scripts directory
that do the following:

* Define default arguments
* Accept arguments to override defaults
* Execute the experiment one or more times
* Detect if the experiment succeeded or failed and terminate the individual 
  run-* experiment/script immediately following first failure.

### Sample execution
#### View help documentation
```
(chaostk) ubuntu@KellyStableClientVirgina:~/chaosindy$ ./scripts/run-force-view-change -h
```
#### Run the force-view-change experiment 1000 times
```
(chaostk) ubuntu@KellyStableClientVirgina:~/chaosindy$ ./scripts/run-force-view-change -e 1000
```
The run-force-view-change experiment will exit with a non-zero exit code as
soon as the first failed force-view-change experiment is encountered. Otherwise,
it will run 1000 iterations of the experiment and exit with a zero exit code.
